# This file is for seed data -- data that is necessary to bootstrap a production database.
# (not demo data -- 'fake' data that is meant to simulate production data)

# Seeding should be indepotent, since this task is run after demo data is imported.
# Demo data may include some or all of the seeds defined here.

# This order allows us to iterate on changes to the seeds for a new feature without repeatedly
# dumping the demo data.
